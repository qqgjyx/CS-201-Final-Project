# CS201 Final Project

## Project Overview
This project, developed for CS201 (Session 2, Fall 2023), is a Java application designed to process and manage a database of people's information. It involves the implementation of various data structures such as Binary Search Trees, Heaps, and Hashmaps to efficiently handle and query the data.

## Features
- **Data Parsing**: Reads and parses data from `people.txt`.
- **Binary Search Tree (MyBST)**: Manages people records, supporting operations like insertion and search.
- **Heap (MyHeap)**: A heap data structure for sorting and prioritizing records.
- **Hashmap (MyHashmap)**: Implements a hashmap with quadratic probing for efficient data retrieval.
- **Database Processing**: Includes methods for loading data, searching, sorting, and analyzing the most frequent words.
